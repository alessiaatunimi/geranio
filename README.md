GERANIO: Graph Evolution Rules ANalytics vIsualization tOolkit

GERANIO is a comprehensive toolkit designed to facilitate the application, visualization and analysis of graph evolution rules algorithms. 
Graph evolution rules capture interpretable patterns describing the transformation of a small subgraph into a new subgraph, providing valuable insights into evolutionary behaviors. This repository provides a set of modules to help you prepare input data in the right format, run algorithms, read the output, and analyze and visualize the results.

## Key Features
The following pipeline describes the process:
